# Rubyconf_talk
Happily preparing our presentation slides for our talk at RubyConfPt  2016  talk at a conference based on the repo created by Rails Girls Summer https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/RGSoC_slides.git

How to go about this? Well... git clone this repo and use it for your own purposes. Or just download the files: 2016_example_slides.key (Keynote) or 2016_example_slides.pdf.
